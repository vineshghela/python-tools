    <p>
     All moneys received by the Trustee in respect of the Notes
                or amounts payable under this Trust Deed shall, despite any appropriation of all or part of them by the
                Issuer,

                of
                Payments and the Intercreditor Deed.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the Trustee holds any moneys in respect of Notes or Coupons that have

                they produce income or deposited in its name or under its control at such bank or other financial
                institution.
                If
                that bank or institution is the Trustee or a subsidiary, holding or associated company of the Trustee,

                independent customer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for any resulting loss, whether by
                depreciation in

        No business (except choosing a chairman) shall be transacted at a meeting unless a quorum is
                            present
                            at
                            the commencement of business. If a quorum is not present within 15 minutes from the time

                            and the

                            present
                            within 15 minutes from the time fixed for a meeting so adjourned, the meeting shall be
