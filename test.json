        "legal_implication": "The scope of what constitutes Confidential Information may be narrower in Document 1, as it is limited to information expressly marked confidential. This could disadvantage the party disclosing information that they intend to be confidential but forget to mark as such.",

        "clause": "3.1.2",

        "legal_implication": "The restriction on disclosure in Document 1 is broader as it captures indirect disclosures. This affords more protection to the disclosing party.",

        "clause": "3.3",
